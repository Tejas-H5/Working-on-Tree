# Example Tree

I am somewhat rethinking my approach to this program.
Really the purpose of a tree is to keep track of progress that we are having subdividing the problem space.
Many times we just do one thing at a time one after the other, and other times they get subdivided.
Other times, I just want to keep track of fringes, or what to come back to next (I suppose this is a lot like depth first search - one case of just a -> b -> c -> ... and the other case of a -> (b1, b2, b3) -> c1 etc)
