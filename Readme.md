# Note Tree (Try it [here](https://tejas-h5.github.io/Working-on-Tree))

A lot of the time, I find myself doing things like this in notepad:

```
- [x] task1
- [x] task2
- [...] task3 big one
    - [...] subtask
        - [...] working...
```

It doesn't last for very long, because the tree of notes becomes very unwieldy very quickly.
However, this process was the inspiration for this web app, which is a hybrid of a note-taking/jounralling program, 
and a time tracking tool with some features for tracking time estimates as well.

The html page can be downloaded and use offline.
