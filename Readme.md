# Working tree (Try it [here](https://tejas-h5.github.io/Working-on-Tree/NoteTree.html))

A lot of the time, I find myself doing things like this in notepad:

```
- [x] task1
- [x] task2
- [...] task3 big one
    - [...] subtask
        - [...] working...
```

It helps me keep track of what my progress is.
This app somewhat automates this, while streamlining the process of cleaning out 'done' tasks, as well as
tracking the exact time at which every task was created, which I might be interested in using for visualizations later.
