// IM-CORE 1.06
// NOTE: I'm currently working on 3 different apps with this framework,
// so even though I thought it was mostly finished, the API appears to still be changing slightly.

import { assert } from "src/utils/assert";

// Conventions
//  - An 'immediate mode' method or 'im' method is any method that eventually _writes_ to the `ImCache`.
//    These methods should ideally be prefixed with 'im'.
//    Conversely, methods that don't touch the imCache, or that will only ever _read_ from the imCache, should NOT be prefixed with 'im'.
//    This allows developers (and in the future, static analysis tools) to know that this method can't be rendered conditionally, or
//    out of order, similar to how React hooks work. This is really the only convention I would recommend you actually follow.
//
//  - imMethods that begin a scope and have a corresponding method to end that scope should be called `im<Name>Begin` and `im<Name>End`. 
//    Some day, I plan on making an eslint rule that will make use of this convention to flag missing closing statements.
//    Though I have significantly reduced the chance of this bug happening with typeIds and such,
//    missing begin/end statements not being paired corectly can still not be caught, and it can 
//    cause some strange behaviour or even silent data corruption in some cases.
//
//    NOTE: This framework still may have methods or utils that I called them so frequently that I omitted the `Begin` from them. 
//    As discussed above, I'm in the process of renaming them to conform to `<Begin>/<End>`. There will be carve-outs for
//    imIf, imSwitch, imFor and other basic control-flow stuff. I should probably just make this 
//    static analysis tool - it would speed up the process...

// Somewhat important that we store these all at 0.

 * Usage:
 * ```ts
 *
 * // Annotating the control flow is needed - otherwise it won't work
 *
 * if (imIf(c) && <condition>) {
 *      // <condition> will by adequately type-narrowed by typescript
 * } else if (imElseIf(c) && <condition2>){
 *      // <condition>'s negative will not by adequately type-narrowed here though, sadly.
 *      // I might raise an issue on their github soon.
 * } else {
 *      imElse(c);
 *      // <condition>'s negative will not by adequately type-narrowed here though, sadly, same as above.
 * } imIfEnd(c);
 *
 * ```
 *
 * It effectively converts a variable number of im-entries into a single if-entry,
 * that has a fixed number of entries within it, so it still abides by 
 * the immediate mode restrictions.
 * This thing works by detecting if 0 things were rendered, and 
 * then detatching the things we rendered last time if that was the case. 
 * Even though code like below will work, you should never write it:
 * ```ts
 * // technically correct but dont do it like this:
 * imIf(c); if (<condition>) {
 * } else {
 *      imElse(c);
 * }imIfEnd(c);
 * ```
 * Because it suggests that you can extend it like the following, which would
 * no longer be correct:
 * ```ts
 * imIf(c); if (<condition>) {
 * } else if (<condition2>) {
 *      // NOO this will throw or corrupt data :((
 *      imElseIf(c);
 * } else {
 *      imElse(c);
 * } imIfEnd(c);
 * ```
 *
 * The framework assumes that every conditional annotation will get called in order,
 * till one of the conditions passes, after which the next annotation is `imIfEnd`. 
 * But now, it is no longer guaranteed that imElseIf will always be called if <condition> was false.
 * This means the framework has no way of telling the difference between the else-if block
 * and the else block (else blocks and else-if blocks are handled the same internally).
