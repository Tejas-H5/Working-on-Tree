// Old code that has been commented out but may only be useful long after I've forgotten I wrote it should go here.
// "But that is what a VCS is for" but whos actually writing code and then thinks to themselves "Oh yeah I remember the function I wrote from that PR 2 years ago, I'll just grab that from VC" ??
// Anway, all the code here should be commented out so it doesn't contribute to the bundle.
// Also, we should clean this up routinely if we know for a fact we don't need it - a bit like real comments
